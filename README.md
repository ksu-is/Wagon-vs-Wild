# Wagon-vs-Wild
A fun adventure game where you use different items to survive encounters in the game. This is designed for everyone to have fun and laugh. 

My goal for this project is to create __5 encounters__ and __6 events__, the encounters will be based on enemies such as zombies. Events are things like, rain, mud and other environmental difficulties.

The insperation for this game is **ATLiens**, and **OriginCodeAcademy**, although Wagon vs Wild will not be as complex as ATliens I still want to create something worth while and fun. Both games can be found on Github!

# Please Note

This game is being created for my application development class, please read the licenses for any legal questions about the code.
